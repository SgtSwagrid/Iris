> [!WARNING]
> Iris is in beta. It is young, it has one user, and anything may change between minor versions.

One small interface for sending prompts and conversations to a large language model,
with adapters for [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages),
[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) and
[Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content), so that switching provider is a matter of configuration.
It is built on [Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/), [sttp](https://sttp.softwaremill.com/) and [Circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/).

Named for [Iris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(mythology)), messenger of the gods,
who carried their words to mortals along the rainbow.

## ⬇️ Installation

Add the following to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.alecdorrington" %% "iris" % "0.1.0"
```

Compiled with Scala `3.9.0`, with no intention to explicitly support older versions. JVM only.

## 🚀 Usage

The public interface is [`LlmClient`](src/main/scala/LlmClient.scala).
Build one for an explicit [`LlmConfig`](src/main/scala/LlmConfig.scala) with `LlmClient.resource`,
over an sttp backend of your own with `LlmClient(config, backend)`,
or from the environment (see [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration)) with `LlmClient.fromEnv`.

Models are named by [`LlmModel`](src/main/scala/LlmModel.scala), each served by one provider,
which is the one a configuration speaks to:

```scala
import com.alecdorrington.iris.{LlmClient, LlmConfig, LlmModel}

LlmClient.resource[IO](LlmConfig(LlmModel.ClaudeOpus5_5, apiKey, maxTokens = 4096))
```

A client prompts its configuration's model alone. For another model, build another client; several
may share one backend through `LlmClient(config, backend)`.

A model Iris does not list yet is named with its provider, as
`LlmModel.of(LlmProvider.Anthropic, "claude-...")`, which gives `None` for a blank name, and the
listed constant for a name Iris lists. A model's `name` is its provider's and its own, as
`anthropic:claude-opus-5-5`, which is how a configuration logs it.

### Single-turn prompts

```scala
import com.alecdorrington.iris.{LlmClient, Prompt}

LlmClient.fromEnv[IO].use {
  case Some(client) => client.send(Prompt("Hello!"))
  case None         => // No provider configured.
}
```

### Conversations

Conversations are stateless: nothing is remembered between calls, and the full history
travels with every request as a [`Chat`](src/main/scala/Chat.scala).
To continue a conversation, append the model's reply and the next user message, then send the chat again:

```scala
import com.alecdorrington.iris.Chat

val chat = Chat().withSystem("You are terse.").user("Name a colour.")
for
  first  <- client.send(chat)
  second <- client.send(chat.assistant(first.text).user("And another."))
yield second.text
```

### Tuning and metadata

Each request accepts [`ReplyOptions`](src/main/scala/ReplyOptions.scala)
(token limit, temperature, top-p, stop sequences, effort), and each
[`Reply`](src/main/scala/Reply.scala) carries the reply text along with a
normalised `StopReason` and token usage counts.

```scala
client.send(chat, ReplyOptions(maxTokens = Some(1024), stopSequences = List("\n\n")))
```

> [!NOTE]
> Anthropic's newer models, the default `ClaudeSonnet5_5` among them, no longer accept sampling
> parameters and reject a request which carries them. Iris omits `temperature` and top-p for those
> models, and for any Anthropic model it does not list, rather than let the request fail; both
> still apply to every other provider, and to Anthropic's older models.

A model that thinks before it answers can be told how much to think with an
[`Effort`](src/main/scala/Effort.scala), from `Low` to `Max`. Less thought is quicker and
cheaper, and leaves more of the token limit for the answer, where a hard request can
otherwise be thought about until none is left. It is sent as Anthropic's `effort`,
OpenAI's `reasoning_effort` and a Gemini thinking budget; a model that cannot be told
refuses the request.

```scala
client.send(chat, ReplyOptions(effort = Some(Effort.Medium)))
```

### Pictures and documents

A message is a list of [`Part`](src/main/scala/Chat.scala)s, so text may travel beside
the media it refers to. A message of text alone is still sent as plain text, so nothing
changes for a conversation which carries none.

```scala
import com.alecdorrington.iris.Part

chat.user(Part.Text("What is in this picture?"), Part.Media("image/png", base64))
```

Anthropic and Gemini take both pictures and documents. OpenAI's chat completions take
pictures only, and a document there fails with `LlmError.Unsupported` rather than being
dropped or sent as something it is not.

### Streaming

Where a reader is waiting, [`LlmStreamer`](src/main/scala/LlmStreamer.scala) delivers the reply
as it is written. It is a capability apart from `LlmClient`, because it needs a backend which
can stream.

```scala
import com.alecdorrington.iris.{Delta, LlmStreamer}

LlmStreamer.fromEnv[IO].use {
  case Some(llm) => llm.stream(Prompt("Tell me a story.")).evalMap {
    case Delta.Text(text)      => IO.print(text)
    case Delta.End(reason, _)  => IO.println(s"\n($reason)")
  }.compile.drain
  case None => IO.unit
}
```

Nothing is sent until the stream is run, and a failure reaches it as an `LlmError` as it
would anywhere else. `Delta.End` carries the token counts where the provider reports them
as it ends; Anthropic counts the input at the start instead, so `send` remains the way to
have both halves together.

### Tools

Offer the model tools it may ask to have run, and it will say so in `Reply.toolCalls`.
Iris never runs a tool itself; what one does, and whether it is allowed to, is yours to decide.

```scala
import com.alecdorrington.iris.{Part, Tool}

val weather = Tool("weather", "Looks up the weather.", schema)

for
  asked  <- client.send(chat, ReplyOptions(tools = List(weather)))
  result  = Part.ToolResult(asked.toolCalls.head.id, "weather", lookUp(asked.toolCalls.head))
  answer <- client.send(chat.assistant(asked).user(result))
yield answer.text
```

A reply which asked for a tool has `StopReason.ToolCall`, on every provider, and so does a
streamed reply's `Delta.End` — Gemini reports no such reason of its own, so the asking is what
says so.

### Counting tokens

`count` asks the provider what a chat would cost to send, so a conversation can be
checked against a budget or a context window before a reply is spent finding out.

```scala
client.count(Prompt("How long is a piece of string?"))
```

OpenAI offers no such endpoint, and fails with `LlmError.Unsupported` rather than
guessing with a tokeniser of its own.

### Caching

When many requests begin alike, as when one document is asked several questions, put what
they share first and end it with a `Part.CacheBreakpoint`, so that the provider can keep what it
made of the prefix rather than read it afresh every time. `Usage.cachedTokens` says how much of a
prompt was read from the cache.

```scala
val asking = (question: String) =>
  Chat().withSystem("Answer from the document.")
    .user(Part.Text(document), Part.CacheBreakpoint, Part.Text(question))

for
  _       <- client.warm(asking(""))
  answers <- questions.parTraverse(question => client.send(asking(question)))
yield answers
```

Requests sent at once cannot read what none of them has written yet, so `warm` writes the prefix
first: everything up to the last breakpoint, asking for as little reply as the provider allows.
A provider answers only a chat which ends with the user saying something, so a prefix which does
not, as when the last breakpoint opens a message to cache only what came before it, is followed
by the least a user can say.

Anthropic caches only what it is told to, and a breakpoint marks the block before it, at most four
blocks in one chat (breakpoints in a row mark one). OpenAI and Gemini cache long prefixes of their
own accord and are sent nothing.
Each provider keeps a cache per model, and caches nothing shorter than its own minimum.

### Errors

A provider's refusal fails the effect with an [`LlmError`](src/main/scala/LlmError.scala):
`Unsuccessful` for an unsuccessful response, carrying its status and body, and `Malformed` for a response
that could not be understood. Response bodies may contain provider detail you would rather not show
to your own users, so consider logging them rather than passing them on.

### Wrapping a client

Iris does no throttling, retrying or logging of its own, so that each host can wrap a client in
exactly the policy it wants. `mapK` runs every request through one transformation, as a limit on
requests in flight does:

```scala
Semaphore[IO](16).map(permits => client.mapK(permits.permit.surroundK))
```

A wrapper that treats requests differently extends `LlmClient.Forwarding`, which passes every
request on, and overrides only what it changes:

```scala
def logged(client: LlmClient[IO]): LlmClient[IO] = new LlmClient.Forwarding(client):
  override def send(chat: Chat, options: ReplyOptions): IO[Reply] =
    client.send(chat, options).flatTap(reply => IO.println(reply.usage))
```

Both pass `warm` on to the client they wrap, as a wrapper must: the default `warm` sends through
`send`, which would lose however the provider itself warms.

## ⚙️ Configuration

`LlmConfig.fromEnv` (and so `LlmClient.fromEnv`) reads these environment variables:

| Variable            | Meaning                                     | Default                        |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `LLM_PROVIDER`      | `anthropic`, `openai` or `gemini`           | `LLM_MODEL`'s, else by key    |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | API key for Anthropic                       | -                              |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`    | API key for OpenAI                          | -                              |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`    | API key for Gemini (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`)    | -                              |
| `LLM_MODEL`         | Model to use, by its API name (see below)   | Provider-specific default      |
| `LLM_MAX_TOKENS`    | Maximum number of tokens in each reply      | `8192`, or the host's default  |
| `LLM_BASE_URL`      | Overrides the provider's API origin         | The provider's own origin      |
| `LLM_TIMEOUT`       | Seconds to wait for a reply                 | `300`                          |

With no key set, `fromEnv` yields `None`. So does a variable which is set but cannot be used:
an unrecognised `LLM_PROVIDER`, rather than falling back to whichever key exists, an `LLM_MODEL`
that names no model Iris lists or one which another provider serves, and an `LLM_MAX_TOKENS`
which is not a positive whole number, rather than quietly reverting to the default and hiding the
mistake. A model Iris does not list is named after its provider and a colon, as
`LLM_MODEL=anthropic:claude-...`, so that a mistyped name is still caught. A Gemini model may
also be written as Gemini's API lists it, as `gemini:models/gemini-...`.

To read several configurations from one environment, as one per kind of request, pass
`LlmConfig.from` a lookup of your own, which it reads every variable above through:

```scala
val fast = LlmConfig.from(name => sys.env.get(s"${name}_FAST").orElse(sys.env.get(name)))
```

To read several configurations from one environment, as one per kind of request, pass
`LlmConfig.from` a lookup of your own, which it reads every variable above through:

```scala
val fast = LlmConfig.from(name => sys.env.get(s"${name}_FAST").orElse(sys.env.get(name)))
```

A host whose replies run longer than most passes its own default for an unset `LLM_MAX_TOKENS`,
as in `LlmConfig.fromEnv(defaultMaxTokens = 16_000)` or `LlmConfig.from(lookup, 16_000)`.
