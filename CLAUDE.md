## Project overview

This is Iris, a Scala 3 library giving one provider-agnostic interface to the APIs of large language models, with
adapters for Anthropic, OpenAI and Google Gemini, built on Cats Effect, sttp and Circe. It is in beta.

It is a single JVM module in `com.alecdorrington.iris`. `LlmClient` is the public interface (`send` a `Chat`
or a `Prompt`). Each `LlmProvider` has one `ProviderApi` object (`AnthropicApi`, `OpenAiApi`, `GeminiApi`, sharing
`JsonHttp`), which tells the one `JsonClient` and the one `SseClient` all they need to know of it: its endpoints,
request bodies, credentials, the chats it refuses, how its replies read, and how it counts tokens. Anything
provider-specific goes there, never in the clients. `LlmConfig` holds a model (and so its provider), key, token limit and an optional base URL, and
`LlmConfig.fromEnv` reads them from `LLM_*` and the providers' `*_API_KEY` variables (`LlmConfig.from` through a
lookup of the host's), with the token limit when `LLM_MAX_TOKENS` is unset a parameter, for hosts whose replies run
longer.

- Clients are stateless: no session identity reaches the provider, and a conversation's whole history travels with
  each `Chat`. Keep it that way.
- Every `ProviderApi` must normalise what it returns: the reply text, a `StopReason` (unknown labels kept as `Other`) and
  token usage in `Reply`. An unsuccessful response is `LlmError.Unsuccessful` (status and body) and an unreadable one
  `LlmError.Malformed`, so hosts can tell rate limits from broken responses; transport failures are sttp's own.
- Models are `LlmModel` cases, never strings: each names the provider serving it (`LlmConfig.provider` is its model's)
  and its API `id`, which `LlmModel.parse` reads back. A model Iris does not list is an `LlmModel.Other`,
  made only by `LlmModel.of(provider, id)` (so that a listed id is always its listed case, and a blank one none, and
  Gemini's `models/` is dropped) and read as `provider:id`, so that a bare name must still be a listed one; list a new model as a case of its own. What one provider's models differ in
  (Anthropic's sampling and prefill) is kept in its `ProviderApi` (`AnthropicApi`), as sets of the cases that still allow it, so that `Other`
  is taken to be as new as the newest. A client prompts its configuration's model alone: no option names another,
  so a request can never reach a provider that does not serve its model. `LlmProvider.defaultModel` must stay a `def`: as a
  constructor parameter, the two enums would each read the other while it is still being made, and see `null`.
- A set but unrecognised `LLM_PROVIDER` or `LLM_MODEL` means unconfigured (`None`), never a fall back to key inference.
- The library does no throttling, retrying or logging of its own; those are the host's to wrap around a client.
  Nor does it run a tool it is asked for: `ReplyOptions.tools` offers them and `Reply.toolCalls`
  reports what was asked, but what a tool does, and whether it may, is the host's.
- A `Part.CacheBreakpoint` ends a prefix worth caching and says nothing to the model. Anthropic is told of one by
  `cache_control` on the block before it (in its message, else the previous message's last, else the system message),
  marking at most four blocks per chat, counted as sent (breakpoints in a row mark one); OpenAI and Gemini cache
  prefixes unasked and are sent nothing, so their APIs drop them (`Message.uncached`). `LlmClient.warm` sends
  `Chat.cacheable` with the least reply the provider allows (`ProviderApi.leastReply`: Anthropic `max_tokens: 0`,
  others 1); a wrapper around a
  client must forward `warm`, not inherit the default, which `LlmClient.Forwarding` (override only what changes) and
  `mapK` (one transformation for every request) both do. `cacheable` always ends with the user saying something:
  breakpoints left alone in the last message move back to what came before, and a prefix ending at the system message
  or the assistant's turn is followed by a user message of `.`. `Usage.inputTokens` counts the whole prompt on every
  provider (Anthropic's `input_tokens` leaves the cache out, so its reads and writes are added back) and
  `Usage.cachedTokens` the part read from the cache.
- `ReplyOptions.effort` (`Effort`, `Low` to `Max`) is sent as Anthropic's `output_config.effort`, OpenAI's
  `reasoning_effort` (`Max` as `high`, its highest) and Gemini's `generationConfig.thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget`
  (fixed amounts within every thinking Gemini model's range). Iris never chooses one, and a model that cannot take one
  refuses the request; retrying at a lower effort is the host's to do.
- Unset optional fields are omitted one level deep, by `JsonHttp.objectOf`/`body`. Never deep-drop nulls: inside a
  tool's schema or a tool call's arguments, a null is a value.
- `LlmStreamer` is a capability apart from `LlmClient`, since streaming needs a backend which can stream.
  `SseClient` speaks the same `ProviderApi` as `JsonClient`, with the same request bodies (`streamed`). Each
  `ProviderApi.reply` reads the whole stream of events, most one event at a time (`Sse.separately`). Gemini's
  remembers across events whether a tool was asked for, as it may say so before it says it stopped.
- `LlmConfig.toString` redacts the API key, so hosts may log a configuration. Keep any new secret out of `toString`
  and out of `LlmError` messages likewise.

See [README.md](README.md) for usage.

### Where this code lives

This repository is a mirror. The library is developed inside a larger private project, beneath `iris/`, and every file
here is copied from there by [GitHub Graph](https://github.com/SgtSwagrid/github-graph) whenever that project's `main`
changes, overwriting whatever is here. So make changes there, never here. The shared configuration (workflows, Scalafmt, IDE settings, `project/plugins-*.sbt`) comes from further upstream still, in
[Scala Library Config](https://github.com/SgtSwagrid/scala-library-config), which syncs into the private project's `iris/` first.
`build.sbt`, `release.sbt`, `project/Dependencies.scala`, `README.md` and this file belong to the library.

### Build

- The root project `iris` is the library itself, published as `iris`. Its id is the library's name because the private
  project includes this build by reference (`ProjectRef(file("iris"), "iris")`), alongside projects of its own.
- The library must never depend on anything in the project that includes it.
- Versions come from git tags (`sbt-ci-release`); publishing a GitHub release publishes to Maven Central.

## Instructions

### Compilation and Diagnostics

- When the user asks for help with a compilation or type error, start by running `sbt compile` to see the error for yourself.
  If there are many errors, making it unclear which one the user is referring to, ask them to clarify, and then focus only on that issue.
- IntelliJ MCP integration is active. When a request seems to implicitly refer to something the user is looking at, always check
  `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` first to see which file(s) are open and get associated diagnostics (errors, warnings, and info hints with line numbers).

#### Testing

- After making code changes, always run `sbt compile` to verify that issues are fixed and no new ones are introduced.
- Repeatedly retry upon failure until the build succeeds. If you are unsure how to fix an issue, ask for help or refer to existing code for examples.
- Before trying to fix an error, make sure you first understand it fully.
- You should never report that a feature is complete without testing it first.

### Code Style

- You must read the [Code Style Guidelines](docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md).
- Document every public type and member: a summary, then `@param` for each explicit parameter,
  `@tparam` for each type parameter, and `@return` for any result but `Unit`, each one short
  sentence. Summaries read: types "A ...", values "The ...", Booleans "Whether ...", methods a
  third-person verb ("Sends ..."), never "Returns ...". Private members get a comment only for a
  non-obvious contract or gotcha, usually in one sentence.

### Pull Requests

When asked to publish the code changes, your task is to open one or more pull requests (PRs) to merge the changes into `main` on GitHub:

- Use `git` to check what has changed as compared to the `main` branch on `origin`.
- If the changes are thematically linked, they can be published as a single PR.
- Otherwise, you'll need to divide the changes into multiple PRs using your own judgement.
- Each PR should have a singular focus, shouldn't break anything, and should be able to be merged independently.
- Ensure that all code is staged, committed and pushed. Ensure no new files are left uncommitted, and no debug code is left in the codebase.
- When creating a PR, ensure that the title and description are clear, informative, and comprehensive.
- All feature/bugfix/etc branch names should be formatted as "feature_<short description>" or "fix_<short description>" or similar.
- All PR titles should be formatted as "[<scope>] <Short summary>", e.g. "[renderer] Fixed colour inversion bug."
- You have GitHub MCP integration that can be used to do the above.
